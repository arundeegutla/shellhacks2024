## What it is
Wordlify lets players create and join online rooms with friends, where they take turns selecting secret words to make into Wordle puzzles for the other players. There's a strategy aspect since scores earned for solving each puzzle are based on both speed and efficiency. Not only that, but you can see the colors of other people's puzzles, opening up a new level of strategy and mind games to play on one another.

## Inspiration
Word games have always been a fun way to challenge the mind, but we wanted to bring a social twist to the classic Wordle experience. Everyone's had the experience of dumping a daily Wordle in one or two or five group chats. We felt that it was possible to get more fun and interactivity out of this game. We were inspired by the excitement of multiplayer games and the joy of sharing moments with friends, which led us to create Wordlify, a word guessing game where friends can challenge each otherâ€™s vocabulary and have fun together.

## How we built it
We developed Wordlify using Next.js and Firebase. We used Next.js to build the frontend and used Firebase for real-time database management, microservices, and hosting. Everything was written in TypeScript, including the game logic. The multiplayer functionality is powered by Firebase's cloud functions, ensuring seamless room creation, live guessing feedback, and real-time previews of your friends' progress.
